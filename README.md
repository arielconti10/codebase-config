This repository is for saving my personal coding preferences such as vscode configs, eslint configs and other files such as 
fonts and anything that's belongs to my default workspace settings. 

So i'll never need to configure this things again 
Feel free to clone it and use it! 

## Available configs
- Eslint (For react) 
- Editorconfig (2 spaces on ident, new line at the end of the file, trim whitespaces) 
- Prettier (Format on save and put it on eslint rules) 
- Material theme configuration with ligatures enabled 
- Fira code font
- Dracula theme

Enjoy it!
